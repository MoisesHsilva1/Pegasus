# Pegasus

Pegasus is a customized Fedora developer environment setup inspired by Omakub.

The goal of Pegasus is to transform a fresh Fedora Workstation installation into a complete, ready-to-use development workstation with pre-configured tools, terminal workflows, desktop themes, and GNOME customizations.
